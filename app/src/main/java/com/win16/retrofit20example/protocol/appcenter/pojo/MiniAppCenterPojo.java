WhatsApp uses your phone\u2019s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, and Voice Messages. First year FREE!* (WhatsApp may charge thereafter, current price is $0.99 USD/year).\nWHY USE WHATSAPP: \n\u2022 NO ADDITIONAL FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone\u2019s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to message and call friends and family, so you don\u2019t have to pay for every message or call.*\n\u2022 MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages.\n\u2022 WHATSAPP CALLING: Call your friends and family using WhatsApp for free, even if they\u2019re in another country. WhatsApp calls use your phone\u2019s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan\u2019s voice minutes.* (Note: you can\u2019t access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). \n\u2022 GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\u2022 WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer\u2019s browser.\n\u2022 NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There\u2019s no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* \n\u2022 SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone\u2019s existing address book. \n\u2022 ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you\u2019re always logged in so you don\u2019t miss messages. No more confusion about whether you\u2019re logged in or logged out. \n\u2022 QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there\u2019s no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\u2022 OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\u2022 AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. \n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe\u2019re always excited to hear from you!
